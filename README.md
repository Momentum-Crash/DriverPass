# DriverPass
CS-255 System Analysis and Design

The client for the DriverPass project was Liam the CEO and Ian the CTO they were looking for a web-based application that student drivers could access either on a mobile device or on a computer. The application needed to allow them to access feedback about their driving from drivers, allow them to study based on documents sent by the DMV, update their information and schedule the meetings for drivers and students to practice driving.

To revise the documents, I would add a model of the system in the initial business requirement document. I forgot to actually model the system and did all of the other requirements which makes it difficult to understand how the system should operate.

I took the users needs and thought about how most web based applications work. There’s typically a login screen that allows users to login to the app, it could be added later an automatic login based on saved data but the base level of the system should just have users log in each time they access the application. After that I thought about how they wanted to access the information on the landing page, the sketches given for the page made this easy to understand what they were looking for. The landing page should have multiple different functions that can be accessed by clicking on them. These are important to think of when designing a system because the final goal is for the system to match what the expectations of the user’s. Since most other systems work similarly they should automatically understand how to operate the application making it easier for everyone to use the system.

I think from the end user’s perspective and question what needs to be included to get to the clients expectations. I think I would like to work with sticky notes and string the next time to design the use case diagram. I think having a physical aspect would help me better ground the action/function.
